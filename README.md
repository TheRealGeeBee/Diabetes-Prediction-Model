# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This repository contains a model that predicts the possibility of someone having diabetes based on some information like age, blood sugar level, etc.

There are three files in this repository. The _first one contains a python class for using the model_, the _second one contains the model itself (as a .pkl file)_, the _third one contains the interactive python notebook that was used to develop the model_.
